# projectSimpson
A Simpson game coded mainly in Javascript


Move around and catch falling object with your mouse.
Languages and technologies used:
- Javascript
- Jquery
- Html, Css, Bootstrap, @media queries for mobile responsivness, Google Fonts
- Object constructors, objects



What have I learned:
- Mobile responsivness with @media queries
- Use of Jquery to simplify overall readibility
- Object contructor to create falling object
- Better use of functions to add functionality (ex. move with mouse, on click events, changing character aspect based on score)
